# RC Performance calculator
This program calculates the approximated topspeed by the following parameter
* lipo cell count 
* transmission by tooth count of spur and pinion gear 
* transmission by differential
* KV of the motor
* diameter of the wheels

## Steps of running
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose up`
* `docker exec -it rcpc-app bash`
* `# npm run build`
* `# npm run start`
